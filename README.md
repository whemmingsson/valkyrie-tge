# Valkyrie TGE
Valkyrie TGE (Text Game Engine) is a game engine for running text adventure games in the likes of Zork (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zork). 

The main ambition of this project is to provide game developers, without extensive programming knowledge, with the kits and tools to create epic interative stories. Without writing a single line of code.  

Instead of using MDL for building the games, Valkyrie relies heaivly on the use of JSON files. Toghether with a rich set of schemas. 

Valkyrie is both a compiler (validator) for Valkyrie game files and an interpretor (engine) for running such files.

## Techstack
The initial version of VTGE is built with Node.

## Core principles
Rooms. Doors. Keys. Triggers. Conditions. Actions.
